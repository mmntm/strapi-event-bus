# Strapi Event Bus
This package streamlines implementation of DDD in your strapi backend. It also provides an opinionated approach to event emitting and event listening. So no more magic strings and loosely typed event payloads.

## Notice!!
Thank you for your interest in this package. However... it's still heavily under development.
This is an alpha alpha version and is nowhere near production ready. Please be patient and wait until we release a full version of this library, before using it.
Thank you for your patience and understanding.
